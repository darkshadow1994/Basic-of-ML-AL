# ML-and-AI-projects
This contain the ML/AI projects.
1) Linear Regression module development using scipy module
   Details: Here we have used height-weight.csv dataset , by using this we have found out the relation between the height-weight .
            The various linear regression coeffienent i.e. slope and intercept are found out.
            And by using this eq. slope*x + intercept i.e. basic regression model we build.
            
2) Explorotry Data Analysis
